            <p>I walked through the door with you</p>
            <p>The air was cold</p>
            <p>But something 'bout it felt like home somehow</p>
            <p>And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house</p>
            <p>And you've still got it in your drawer even now</p>
            <br />
            <p>Oh, your sweet disposition</p>
            <p>And my wide-eyed gaze</p>
            <p>We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate</p>
            <p>Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place</p>
            <p>And I can picture it after all these days</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more</p>
            <p></p>And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all</p>
            <br>
            <p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street</p>
            <p>You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me</p>
            <p>Wind in my hair, I was there</p>
            <p>I remember it all too well</p>
            <br>
            <p>Photo album on the counter</p>
            <p>Your cheeks were turning red</p>
            <p>You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed</p>
            <p>And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team</p>
            <p>You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me</p>
            <br> 
            <p>And you were tossing me the car keys</p>
            <p>"F- the patriarchy" keychain on the ground</p>
            <p>We were always skipping town</p>
            <p>And I was thinking on the drive down</p>
            <p>Any time now, he's gonna say it's love</p>
            <p>ou never called it what it was</p> 
            <!-- <br>
            <p>'Til we were dead and gone and buried</p>
            <p>Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same</p>
            <p>After three months in the grave</p>
            <p>And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you</p>
            <p>But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do</p>
            <p>And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to</p>
            <br>
            <p>'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night</p>
            <p>We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light</p>
            <p>Down the stairs, I was there</p>
            <p>I remember it all too well</p>
            <br>
            <p>And there we are again when nobody had to know</p>
            <p>You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath</p>
            <p>Sacred prayer and we'd swear</p>
            <p>To remember it all too well</p>
            <br>
            <p>Well, maybe we got lost in translation</p>
            <p>Maybe I asked for too much</p>
            <p>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up</p>
            <p>Running scared, I was there</p>
            <p>I remember it all too well</p>
